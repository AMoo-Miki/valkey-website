This Policy provides guidelines for use of the “Valkey” name and logo (the “Valkey Trademarks”) to identify the Valkey software. Linux Foundation strives to be a steward of the Valkey brand for the entire Valkey Community and is the owner of the Valkey Trademarks. As such, the law obligates us to police and protect the trademarks. Therefore, we require use of the Valkey Trademarks to be in accordance with this policy.

Our goal is to ensure, on behalf of the Valkey Community, that the Valkey Trademark remain reliable indicators of quality and security while also permitting community members, software distributors and others to discuss Valkey and to accurately describe their products’ affiliation with Valkey or the Valkey
Community, as well as exercise their rights given Valkey’s open source nature. Note that this policy only applies to use of the Valkey Trademarks.

## Overall Guidelines

You may use the “Valkey” word mark to refer to the Valkey software provided that your use is in compliance with this policy. Any other use of the Valkey Trademarks, including any logos, requires prior written permission.

Overall, your use of the Valkey Trademarks must not be confusing, misleading, false, or damaging to the Valkey software, the Valkey Community or to the Valkey Trademarks themselves. 

People should always know who they are dealing with, and where the software they are downloading and using came from. You may not use the Valkey Trademarks in any manner that implies approval or endorsement by, or association with, the Valkey project or the Valkey Community. When using the Valkey Trademarks, your branding should be distinguishable from Valkey trade dress.

You may not use the Valkey Trademarks in a manner that may diminish or otherwise damage the goodwill in the Valkey Trademarks. The “Valkey” word mark should be used in its exact form, and not abbreviated or combined with any other word or words (e.g., “Valkey” software rather than “Valkey-ified”).

Your use of the Valkey Trademarks does not transfer rights in the trademarks or goodwill to you.

## Uses that do not require permission

Provided your use complies with this policy, you may use the “Valkey” word mark to accurately reference the Valkey software, including on your website, in presentations and publications, at events, in advertising and marketing material, etc., for commercial and noncommercial purposes.

You may use the “Valkey” word mark and any logos we placed on the software in connection with a redistribution of an official distribution of the Valkey software that has not been modified or changed in any way.

Those taking full advantage of the open source nature of the Valkey code may make modifications in accordance with the applicable open source license to create Derivative Works (as defined in the Apache License, version 2.0) of Valkey. You may use the “Valkey” word mark to refer to your Derivative Works of Valkey provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the Derivative Works (e.g., “Foocorp’s Valkey Derivative”), (b) you clearly identify your modifications and indicate you are the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Valkey or the Valkey Community and you or your Derivative Works of Valkey, and (d) your use of the “Valkey” word mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

Those taking advantage of the open source nature of the Valkey code may also offer services for, or software that works with, Valkey or Derivative Works of Valkey, such as cloud management services. Users should not be confused as to the source of your software or services. With that in mind, you may use the “Valkey” word mark to refer to services for, or software that works with, Valkey or Derivative Works of Valkey provided (a) you include an additional identifier indicating you as the source of the software or services (e.g., “Foocorp’s Valkey Tool” or “Foocorp Valkey Service”), (b) if your services or software works with Derivative Works of Valkey, you clearly identify the modifications and indicate the source of the modifications, (c) your use does not suggest any affiliation between Valkey or the Valkey Community and you or your work, and (d) your use of the “Valkey” mark should not be more prominent than your additional identifier.

You may also use the “Valkey” word mark to make accurate statements about compatibility and interoperability using relational phrases such as “works with,” “runs on,” “compatible with,” and the like (e.g., “Foocorp Software powered by Valkey” or “Foocorp Software for Valkey” or “Foocorp Software with Valkey compatibility”).

## Uses that require permission

* Use of the Valkey logos in any way other than as expressly authorized by this Policy;
